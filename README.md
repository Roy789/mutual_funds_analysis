# mutual_funds_analysis
This project uses different machine learning methods to understand and predict the price change in some mutual funds. The first fund to be analysed is the ICICI prudential Mutual technology growth fund. 

The steps that are going to be followed:
Getting the historic NAV's from 'https://www.amfiindia.com' in the form of a text file and then using python for data extraction from that particular text_file and outputting it in the format of a csv_file.
